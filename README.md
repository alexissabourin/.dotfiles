## Shell/tooling

I use [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh) as my main shell with [omz](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) for better defaults and plugin management.

## Multiplexing

I use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) with [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) for projects layouts and [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) for plugin management.

## Text editor

I use [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) with a custom configuration *(greatly inspired by this [blog post](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-neovim-2024))* and [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugin management.
